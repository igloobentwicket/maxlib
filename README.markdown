# Mattly's Max Library

These are bits and pieces of my library of tools (abstractions, jsui widgets, etc) for creating [Max/MSP](http://cycling74.com/products/max5) patches. They require Max/MSP 5.0.x or later. 

## Abstractions

- mattly.gridboard.js
  > Turns coordinates into notes and notes into coordinates. Works similar to the keyboard aspect of stretta's "fourths" patch, but can display notes from external sources.

- mattly.gridpages.js
  > Manages several grids via one master one.

- mattly.monome
  > Basic front-end for talking to a Monome. Uses an OSC prefix of /monome and looks for button presses. Send it messages via the inlet and the prefixing is taken care of for you.  

- mattly.ledgrid.js
  > a someone misleadly-named grid controller. in addition to turning "x y 0" messages into "led x y 0", it can also take "x y blink 4" messages and cause that light to blink 4 times per second.

- mattly.subgrid.js
  > Divide a large grid into smaller ones, then put it back together again. Designed for use with a monome but could be used in other contexts.

- mattly.symjoin.js
  > Concatenates a message into a symbol.
